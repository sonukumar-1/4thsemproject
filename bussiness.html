            model, so there are many unique approaches under this umbrella.Anything you buy in an online store as a
            consumer — think wardrobe, household supplies, entertainment — is
            done as part of a <strong>B2C</strong> transaction. The decision-making process for a B2C purchase is much shorter than a
            business-to- business (B2B) purchase,especially for items that have a lower value.
